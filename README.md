- 👋 Hi, I’m @melinebel, I'm a student of Data whose biggest passion is to gain insights into human behavior through analysis. 
- 👀 I’m interested in human decision-making, storytelling, art and entertainment.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to leverage modern Data Science tools (such as Python, SQL and Big Data Management Solutions) to acquire valuable intuitions.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything as long as it's novel, fresh and relates to human decision-making.
- 📫 You can reach me at mnebelg@outlook.com
